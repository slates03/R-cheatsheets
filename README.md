## R

### Basic R

### Advanced R

[advancedR.pdf](https://github.com/slates03/R-cheatsheets/files/8124944/advancedR.pdf)

### R studio

### data.table
data.table is an extremely fast and memory efficient package for transforming data in R. It works by converting R’s native data frame objects into data.tables with new and enhanced functionality.

### tidiverse

### ggplot2
The ggplot2 package lets you make beautiful and customizable plots of your data. It implements the grammar of graphics, an easy to use system for building plots.

### dplyr
The dplyr package provides a grammar for manipulating tables in R. This cheatsheet will guide you through the grammar, reminding you how to select, filter, arrange, mutate, summarise, group, and join data frames and tibbles.

### tidyr
The tidyr package provides a framework for creating and shaping tidy data, the data format that works the most seamlessly with R and the tidyverse. The front page of this cheatsheet provides an overview of tibbles and reshaping tidy data. The back page provides an overview of creating, reshaping, and transforming nested data and list-columns with tidyr, tibble, and dplyr. With list-columns, you can use a simple data frame to organize any collection of objects in R.

### tidyr
The tidyverse provides several packages for importing data into R and this cheatsheet covers three of them. On the front page: read and parse text files including csv, tsv, or fwf with readr. On the back page: read and write Excel spreadsheets with readxl and work with Google Sheets files with googlesheets4.

### purrr
The purrr package makes it easy to work with lists and functions. This cheatsheet will remind you how to manipulate lists with purrr functions as well as how to apply functions iteratively to each element of a list or vector using map functions

### stringr
The stringr package provides an easy to use toolkit for working with strings, i.e. character data, in R. This cheatsheet guides you through stringr’s functions for manipulating strings. The back page provides a concise reference to regular expressions, a mini-language for describing, finding, and matching patterns in strings

### forcats 
Factors are R’s data structure for categorical data. The forcats package makes it easy to work with factors. This cheatsheet reminds you how to make factors, reorder their levels, recode their values, and more

[factors.pdf](https://github.com/slates03/R-cheatsheets/files/8124925/factors.pdf)

### lubridate
The lubridate package makes it easier to work with dates and times in R. This cheatsheet covers how to round dates, work with time zones, extract elements of a date or time, parse dates into R and more. The back of the cheatsheet describes lubridate’s three timespan classes: periods, durations, and intervals; and explains how to do math with date-times.
